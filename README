BUILDING
-------------

Manual building steps:

1. in "bsl" directory type 'make'   
2. copy 'bsl' binary to '/boot/common/bin'
1. in "rez" directory type 'make'   
2. copy 'rez' binary to '/boot/common/bin'
4. in 'sum-it' directory type 'make'
5. You have working OpenSum-It binary

All above steps can be done in one go automatically using shell script:

> build.sh



!!! By default build system makes OpenSum-It binary with DEBUG turned on, so it is a bit heavy.
