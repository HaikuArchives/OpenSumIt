I am allready succeeded to compile Sum-It, just commiting changes step by step, so be patient :)

All work has been done on HAIKU gcc4 dev. environment only, so i am not aware if my changes will break or allready broke compiling on HAIKU gcc2 or BeOS/Zeta.

Plan is to fix errors compiling with gcc4 and to open possibility, that everybody interested could start testing, fixing, developing, expanding and so on... 

Sum-It build system needs special tools: bsl and rez. Some people were frustrated by trying to compile Sum-It, because these tools were missing on this repository. It's good that they still were in old place, so now they have been imported to new home.
